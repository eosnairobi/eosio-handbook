# **Introduction**

_This is a step by step walk through on how to clone, build and run a single node on your machine, handling all the small issues you may face along the way._

**Step 1**. **Clone EOS**

```
git clone https://github.com/EOSIO/eos --recursive
```

Just be patient, this may take a while.

**Step 2. Checkout the appropriate Tag**

If you follow the tutorial on [developers.eos.io](https://developers.eos.io "EOSIO Developers&apos; Guide"), you will have to checkout `v1.0.0`. In this tutorial, we start with the same tag \(`v1.0.`0, but we shall do another one soon enough\).
